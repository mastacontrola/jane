Windows Server supports different levels of script authentication:

	Restricted - No scripts can be run. Windows PowerShell can be used only in interactive mode.
	AllSigned - Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can be run.
	RemoteSigned - Downloaded scripts must be signed by a trusted publisher before they can be run.
	Unrestricted - No restrictions; all Windows PowerShell scripts can be run.

for signing - I've signed the files with OpenSSL x.509 and imported the public certificate into windows certificate manager however the way that OpenSSL signs the files seems to be incompatible with how Powershell verifies files.

To set script authentication in windows server:
Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted

Example powershell file to run as a scheduled task:

#This file should be stored locally on the server that will execute the import scripts,
#and scheduled to run however often is needed. 
#Paths and filenames need adjusted apropriately.
#
#Redirecting the output to a log file is optional but can help with diagnosing issues.

powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file Z:\abc.ps1 | Out-File z:\Jane.log -Append
powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file Z:\def.ps1 | Out-File z:\Jane.log -Append
Remove-Item Z:\abc.ps1
Remove-Item Z:\def.ps1
