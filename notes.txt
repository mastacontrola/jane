Windows Server supports different levels of script authentication:

	Restricted - No scripts can be run. Windows PowerShell can be used only in interactive mode.
	AllSigned - Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can be run.
	RemoteSigned - Downloaded scripts must be signed by a trusted publisher before they can be run.
	Unrestricted - No restrictions; all Windows PowerShell scripts can be run.

Linux can sign these scripts and authenticate in this manner. Not within the scope of a 0.01 release - but absolutely going to be integrated in future versions.
