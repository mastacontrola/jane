Windows Server supports different levels of script authentication:

	Restricted - No scripts can be run. Windows PowerShell can be used only in interactive mode.
	AllSigned - Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can be run.
	RemoteSigned - Downloaded scripts must be signed by a trusted publisher before they can be run.
	Unrestricted - No restrictions; all Windows PowerShell scripts can be run.

for signing - I've signed the files with OpenSSL x.509 and imported the public certificate into windows certificate manager however the way that OpenSSL signs the files seems to be incompatible with how Powershell verifies files.

To set script authentication in windows server:
Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
